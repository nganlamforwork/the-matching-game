The green block is the current block you are pointing to.

How to move:
	 UP			    W

LEFT		RIGHT	OR	A	D

	DOWN			    S

Press ENTER to select the block. Now, it turns red.

If you have choosed 2 blocks, we will check:
1. If 2 blocks are matched, we will delete them.
2. If 2 blocks aren't matched, we will bring it back to original.

The game ends when:
1. All blocks were deleted.
2. There aren't any couple of blocks that can be matched.

Got stuck? Press H for MOVE SUGGESTION.

DIFFICULT MODE: if there are any gap between 2 blocks (on the same
column), the above blocks will slide down to fill the gap. We call
that all blocks have gravity and they can't hovering in the air (like
the real life).

Thank you for choosing our game! Wish you have fun!
