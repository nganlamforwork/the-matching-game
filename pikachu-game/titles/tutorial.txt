The green block is the current block you are pointing to.
How to move:
         UP			   W
LEFT            RIGHT    OR    A       D
        DOWN                       S

Press ENTER to select the block. Now, it turns red.

We only delete 2 choosen blocks when they are matched (I, L, Z, U patterns)

The game ends when: All blocks were deleted or there aren't any couple of 
blocks that can be matched.

Got stuck? Press H for MOVE SUGGESTION.

DIFFICULT MODE: if there are any gap between 2 blocks (on the same column),
the above blocks will slide down to fill the gap. We call that all blocks 
have gravity and they can't hovering in the air (like the real life).

Thank you for choosing our game! Wish you have fun!
